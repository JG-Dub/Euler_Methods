""" This investigation involved the modelling of a hypothetical solar system. Where there is one
planet orbiting around the sun. Using numerical Euler and Euler-Cromer methods we have modelled the orbit of this
planet around the sun. This allowed the properties of the of our model system to be investigated,
furthermore, comparisons between the algorithm and exact solutions gives us valuable insight
into the nature of the approximations used.

The Euler-Cromer method is a reasonable approximator of planetary motion once a small enough time step (dt) is used. From this Keplers 2nd law can be verifed.
